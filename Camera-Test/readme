Depending on your camera model it might not be supported by deeplabcutlive.
In that case you can use a virtual camera with software like OBS.

Find the port for the camera/obs
```bash
import cv2

for i in range(10):  # Try indexes 0-9
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(i)
    if cap.isOpened():
        print(f"Camera {i} is available")
        cap.release()

```
