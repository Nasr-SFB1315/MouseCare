# Using the Network
---
We have provided two versions of the network, the [adaptable](https://github.com/Nasr-SFB1315/MouseCare/tree/main/trained%20Network/adaptable) and the [exported](https://github.com/Nasr-SFB1315/MouseCare/tree/main/trained%20Network/exported) version.

The exported Version:
Only the exported version can be used with deeplabcut live, but it cannot be further trained or refined.

The trained version:
This version can be further trained/refined and, at a later time point, exported.



### TensorFlow vs PyTorch 
While both versions are available with deeplabcut only TensorFlow is available (at the time of writing) with deeplabcut live gui. The goal of MouseCare was to have an easy-to-use solution, and for that, the GUI (graphical user interface) is an important part. Since MouseCare does not require either to function, it can still be used at a later time point with PyTorch.
