 # MouseCare


MouseCare is a python based solution to evaluate the stress of mice based on tracked facial features. The software is available to download from this folder. 
Following are the basic concepts on which the stress evaluation is based on. 
This description is seperated into the different facial features and how they are evaluated to better understand the code.

### Obtaining the positional data of the facial features:

By integrating MouseCare into dlc live we can get the positional data (x and y coordinates) of each facial feature, stored in a data frame ordered by frame it was collected. 
It is important to update the <strong>FrameRate</strong> variable in the code to be the same as the video.
