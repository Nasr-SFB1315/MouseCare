# Example

To test the functionality of MouseCare on your system, we have provided a video file here. To use a video instead of a live feed, all you need to do is go to <strong> Edit Camera Settings</strong>  and set <strong> camera device</strong>  to <strong> -1 </strong> and then <strong> Init Cam </strong> to load a video. After this, you can follow the instructions to set up MouseCare. This should result in a fully functioning MouseCare system.
